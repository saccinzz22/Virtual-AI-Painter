# ✋ Virtual Hand Painter 🎨  
A computer vision-based application that allows users to draw digitally using only hand gestures. The project leverages **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **OpenCV** for real-time video processing.  

## ✨ Features  

### 🤖 Real-time Hand Tracking with Machine Learning  
- Uses **MediaPipe’s deep learning-based hand tracking model** to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.  
- Identifies key hand positions and maps gestures to drawing actions with high accuracy.  

### 🖍️ Multiple Drawing Modes  
- **✏️ Freehand Drawing:** Move your **index finger** to draw continuous strokes.  
- **🟦 Rectangle Mode:** Draw precise rectangles using hand gestures.  
- **⭕ Circle Mode:** Create circles by defining center and radius with hand movements.  
- **📏 Straight Line Mode:** Draw straight lines between two tracked points.  

### 🖐️ Gesture-based Full Canvas Clear  
- Instead of manual input, a specific **hand gesture** clears the entire drawing canvas instantly.  

### 📸 Screenshot and Save Feature  
- Capture your artwork and save it as an image file for future reference.  

### 🚀 Machine Learning-powered Efficiency  
- **Lightweight deep learning model** enables fast hand tracking without requiring a dedicated GPU.  
- **Computer vision algorithms** optimize gesture recognition and stroke rendering.  
- **Highly responsive drawing system** ensures minimal lag between gesture recognition and visual output.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – For computer vision processing  
- **MediaPipe** – Deep learning-based hand tracking  

## 🔧 Installation
